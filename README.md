#GITting some practice
##Michael Royer
This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence. ;-P I'm not much for writing.

My computer is really old, and I recently had a power outage while I was working on it.
Now, it is much slower, like a lot slower, and for some reason the Windows search function 
does not work. So, if I want to access programs I have to use file explorer or the windows 
command line which I thankfully had saved to my taskbar. Hopefully I can make it last 
until black Friday. Hopefully.

I hope just adding random stuff to the .py and .md file is ok if not...sorryyy... 
I'll add another file to be safe.
